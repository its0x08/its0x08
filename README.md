### Hello <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px" height="25px"> 
I am a software engineer with a passion for technology and a love for open source. I write code primarily in 🐍 Python, 📜 Javascript/Nodejs/Reactjs, 🐚 Bash, and 📊 MySQL/SQLite, but I'm always willing to learn and try new things.

In addition to software engineering, I am also a cybersecurity researcher and DevOps engineer. I have experience in managing and securing systems in both on-premises and cloud environments.

In my free time, you can find me participating in CTFs or trying my hand at Bug Bounties. I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills and contribute more to the open source community.
